def extract_job_json(job_description):

    You are an AI assistant that extracts structured job details from unstructured job descriptions.
    Return the result as **valid JSON only**, no extra text.

    Schema (always include these fields, even if missing):
    {{
      "Role": string,
      "Required Skills": list of strings,
      "Location Preference": string or null,
      "Content Categories": list of strings,
      "Budget": string or null,
      "Special Preferences": string or null,
      "Creator Name": string or null,
      "Creator Channel": string or null
    }}

    Rules:
    - If any field is not explicitly mentioned, set its value to null (do not guess).
    - Extract skills as they appear in the text.
    - Content Categories can include multiple (Entertainment, Food & Cooking, Productivity, etc).
    - Keep budget in the same unit (e.g., "$2500/month" or "100-150 per hour").
    - Parse creator/channel name from YouTube URL if possible.
